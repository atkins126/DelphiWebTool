## What's New (User Facing) 
 * Started Front End set up and development. 
 * API for the backend.  


## Work Summary (Developer Facing) 
Our team was able to accomplish a couple of main goals this sprint which included data base design, front end design, and backend implementation. For the data base design, we made a diagram showing what was on each table and the relationships between the tables. The front-end design used Figma where we started designing different pages and made a prototype of the user flows. The backend implementation included the backend setup with Express and the implementation of each table and their CRUD functions. 

One challenge came from the Survey Creator product from SurveyJS being a paid model. This resulted in the need to develop a Survey Creator page from scratch.  

## Unfinished Work 
Unfinished work includes the completion of the Survey-Creator Prototype page and the exploration of SurveyJS by Griffin. Learning SurveyJS will be a continuous process that will extend through following sprints.
