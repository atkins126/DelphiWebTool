## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

In our first sprint for the Delphi Web Tool, we began by tackling the planning stages of our project. Our first meeting with our client laid the foundations for our work on the Project Description section of our report. In our Project Description, we began researching the project, investigating background information and relevant topics. Springboarding off of the Project Description section and relying on input from our client, we also developed the Project Requirements and Specifications report. In the meantime, team members also engaged in independent learning of necessary skills so that development in future sprints will be smooth. 

## Unfinished Work
We received comments from our client for revision of our Project Requirements and Specifications document. Due to the timing of the meeting (at the end of the sprint), we did not have the time to review and implement all the requested changes. These changes must be completed at the beginning of the next sprint, as they will inform our steps moving forward.
