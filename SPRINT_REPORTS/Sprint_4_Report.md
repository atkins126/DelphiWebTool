\#\# Work Summary (Developer Facing)  
During this sprint, the goal was to complete the core functionality of our web application. We accomplished this by adding the ability to create multiple survey rounds in line with the Delphi philosophy, creating a system for creators to publish a survey, and letting participants respond to a survey. Now that these core functionalities are in place, there is a complete flow from survey creator to participant.  
\#\# Unfinished Work  
Analysis of the results remains an incomplete task. The first steps for the completion of result analysis have been taken, through result gathering and storage in our database. This was expected to be completed in the next sprint and will be the primary focus of our upcoming work.
