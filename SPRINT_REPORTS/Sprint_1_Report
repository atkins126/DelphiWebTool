## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

In our first sprint for the Delphi Web Tool, we began by tackling the planning stages of our project. Our first meeting with our client laid the foundations for our work on the Project Description section of our report. In our Project Description, we began researching the project, investigating background information and relevant topics. Springboarding off of the Project Description section and relying on input from our client, we also developed the Project Requirements and Specifications report. In the meantime, team members also engaged in independent learning of necessary skills so that development in future sprints will be smooth.

For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.
